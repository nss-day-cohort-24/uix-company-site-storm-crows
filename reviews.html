        <h2>How We Started</h2></div>
        <section class="teamBackground">
            <p>The <strong>You got this</strong> team was joined back in 1986 when a group of developers got together to start a project to help give back to the community. They saw a need for self-improvement programs catered towards children and decided to develop an organization focused on bridging that gap. Over the past 30 years they have grown to help an average of 2,500 children anually and in total 75,000 to date. Their popularity has since expanded them in reaching all of the 51 States of America with similar programs to meet the needs of children all over the country.

            <p>"I was hesitant to sign my boy Charlie up for kickball because he has been bullied in the past in team sports. I realize that this is exactly what he needs and playing with a team under the direction of a positive and encouraging coach has given him a new confidence in team sports. Coach Jimmy set the tone for the entire team with an intolerance for intimidating behaviour and established an overall atomosphere of acceptance." <span class="standoutText">--Dotty Carlisle</span></p>
        
            <p>"Thank you so much to the teachers and volunteers of <strong>You got this</strong>. Mr. Mike was the coolest ropes course instructor ever." <span class="standoutText">--Samuel Dean</span></p>
        
            <p>"My favorite activity was going on the canoe trip and making new friends. It was so awesome and I'm so glad my parents decided to sign me up." <span class="standoutText">--Justin Moore</span></p>
        
            <p>"I'll never forget the first year that I went to a <strong>You got this</strong> art class. I was 11 years old and a very shy introvert. The staff was so nice and they encouraged me to meet the kids in the class and not to be afraid of making new friends. Those years really brought me out of my shell and taught me to be confident and have solid self-esteem. I now have kids of my own and this year my 9 year old daughter will get to be a part of her first program. I'm so glad I've had the chance to pass on this wonderful experience to her and have positive influences in her life." <span class="standoutText">--Liza Jenson</span></p>
